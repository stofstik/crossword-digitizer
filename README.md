# Crossword Digitizer

### About
Lets you play your favorite crossword puzzle in the browser.  
Using handwritten edge detection for <input /> field placement  
Plus client side file upload which gets saved to localstorage as text : )  
And some odd pdf to canvas magic which doesn't work all that well cross browsers...  
Check the source for all the weirdness. It can definitely be improved.  

### Argh!
Does not play well with iPhones. Try Chrome : )  
It needs work in general actually, but did not find the time : p
